Multi-objective Lamarckian CoDeepNEAT (MOLamaCoDeepNEAT) is neural architecture search method enriching [the CoDeepNEAT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00548) with multi-objective optimization. This code is a part of a master thesis.

The MOLamaCoDeepNEAT implementation is based on the CoDeepNEAT implemented in [the Tensorflow-Neuroevolution framework](https://github.com/PaulPauls/Tensorflow-Neuroevolution) (by Paul Pauls) and it uses Tensorflow 2.x. The code includes experiments with the [MNIST](https://tfne.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environments/mnist-environment.html) and [CIFAR-10](https://tfne.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environments/cifar10-environment.html) datasets.
